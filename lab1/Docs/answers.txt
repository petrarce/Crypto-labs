	===DES:
	DES is a block cipher, it encrypts data in 64-bit blocks
	DES is a symmetric algorithm: The same algorithm
	and key are used for both encryption and decryption (except for minor
	differences in the key schedule).At its simplest level, the algorithm is nothing more than a combination of the
	two basic techniques of encryption: confusion and diffusion

A3:
	DES:
	The secret DES key shared between the communicating parties is eight
   octets in length.  This key consists of a 56-bit quantity used by the
   DES algorithm.  The 56-bit key is stored as a 64-bit (eight octet)
   quantity, with the least significant bit of each octet used as a
   parity bit.
